Description: # ResearchPlot
        
        ## Overview
        
        ResearchPlot a python package based on mpltex of liuyxpp for making publication quality figures using matplotlib. The original mpltex package is very convenient for students who make scientific plots with matplotlib. However, it only has one colormap and the settings, e.g. label space, markeredge..., are limited. In this package, I added several different colormaps and made it flexible for customizing the figure settings.
